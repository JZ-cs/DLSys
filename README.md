# Homework of DLSys and simple triton extention
# Why OpenAI trion?
- I think the purpose of this course is to provide an overview, a wide range instead of going deeper.
- If using pycuda or cuda c/c++, it's not easy to write and debug simple element wise kernels, and kernels like GEMM are impossible to accomplish in a short time.
- OpenAI trion allows writing efficient kernels easily in python code. The problem here is, I use the PTX code generated by triton and insert it with pycuda, it's gpu architecture specific.
